#### Summary
A brief overview of Trusts in AD

#### Trust
- In AD, trust is a relationship between two domains or forests which allow users of one domain or forest to access resources in the other
- Trusts can be
	- Automatic - (parent-child, same forest etc)
	- Established (forest, external)
- Trust Domain Objects(TDOs) represent these relationships in a domain
- Trusts are always established in the forest level.

#### Trust Direction
**One-way**: Unidirectional trust

![[trustdir.png]]
Direction of access is opposite to firection of trust

**Two way**: Bidirectional

_Note: Users must have enough privialges to access the resources_

**Trust transitivity**

![[trust transitivity.png]]
All default intra forest trust relationships between domains within a same forest are transitive 2 way trusts
- Tree-root
- Parent-child

Non transitive - cannot be extended to other domains in forests can be oneway or two way
- Eg: Default trust (aka external trust) between two domains in different forests when forests do not have a trust relationship

#### Types Trust 
- Domain trusts
	- Default/Automatic trusts
		- **Parent-Child trust** : Created automatically between new domain and domain that preceeds in the namespace hierarchy, whenever a new domain is added in a tree. ==Always two way transitive==
			- Eg: dollarcorp.moneycorp.local is child of moneycorp.local
			
		- **Tree-root trust** : created automatically when a new domain tree is added to a forest root. ==Always two way transitive==

		- **Shortcut trust** : manually established trusts in complex scenarios to reduce access time. ==Can be one way or two way transitive.==
		
		 ![[trusttypes.png]]
	
		- **External trusts** : established between two domains in different forests which do not have a trust relationship. ==Can be one way or two way. It is non-transitive==.

- **Forest Trusts**
	- Must be set manually
	- Between forest root domains
	- Cannot be extended to third forest (no implicit trust)
	- Can be one way or two way and transitive (must be set manually) or non transitive
	- In diagram below 
		- forest 1 trusts forest 2 bi directionally and
		- forest 2 trusts forest 3 bi directionally. 
		- This doesnt necessarily imply forest 1 trusts forest 3
