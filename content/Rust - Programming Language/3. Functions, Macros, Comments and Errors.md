#### Functions 
---
Functions ,Just like in other programming languages, is a piece of code which performs an action that can be used repeatedly.
```rust
fn main(){
	println!("Hello world!");
}
```

Here `main` is a function
#### Macros
---
Macros are built in functions that help you do specific tasks

```rust
fn main(){
	println!("Hello world!");
}

```

Here `println` is a macro - we can identify macros with `!` sign after macro name.


#### println! vs print!
---
`println!` macro adds a new line to the output but `!print` doesn't.
So `println!` is prefered over `!print`

```rust
//this is a single line comment

/*
This is a 
multiline comment
*/
```
