#### Create Space
Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop to look around once in a while you could miss it.

If I wanted to do my best work, I needed to do fewer things, and really focus on what mattered. ocusing on what matters means saying no to things that don’t matter. Otherwise, your life becomes cluttered with distractions.

To allow yourself time to think, there are many non-technological tricks to  managing information. All of them require you to make choices to focus your  energy. I like to set aside blocks of time for specific activities - even to read or chat

So to make the most of your life, say no to things that don’t matter, work hard at what you love, and occasionally take time away from your core focus to rest so that your mind can be quiet for great insights to come.

#### Try not to worry
