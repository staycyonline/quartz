 [Installing `rustup` on Windows](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows)

On Windows, go to [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you’ll receive a message explaining that you’ll also need the MSVC build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later.

To acquire the build tools, you’ll need to install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). When asked which workloads to install, include:

- “Desktop Development with C++”
- The Windows 10 or 11 SDK
- The English language pack component, along with any other language pack of your choosing

The rest of this book uses commands that work in both _cmd.exe_ and PowerShell. If there are specific differences, we’ll explain which to use.
